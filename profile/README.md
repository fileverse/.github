### About Fileverse
In an era where online collaboration is controlled by monopolistic platforms that compromise privacy and creativity, Fileverse is building healthier alternatives with at its core self-sovereignty, privacy by design, and standards compliance. 

💛 [ddocs.new](http://ddocs.new/) (Public Beta) is your privacy-enhancing alternative to G**gle D*cs: onchain, end-to-end encrypted, and decentralized. It supports both async and real-time collaboration, works seamlessly on mobile and desktop, and doesn’t require an account. With dDocs you can write, collaborate, and share knowledge in a self-sovereign way and without sacrificing privacy.

👩‍💻 [Fileverse Portal (Private Beta)](https://fileverse.io/portal) is your onchain space for everyday online activities: peer-to-peer file-sharing and storage via IPFS & Arweave, publishing decentralized websites/knowledge bases/portfolios, collaborative document editing (via dDocs), brainstorming on whiteboards, and creating onchain communities with trustless co-management (via Safe multisigs)

### 🛠️ Fileverse SDKs: 
- [HeartBit SDK](https://fileverse.io/heartbit): provable, time-based onchain "Likes" that can be generated by simply engaging with your app, website, onchain media, Frame or OpenAction on Farcaster and Lens protocols!
- [Agents SDK](https://agents.fileverse.io/): gives any AI agent the capability to read and write onchain. Out of the box agents get their own Safe smart account, a smart contract on Gnosis, storage space on IPFS, & human-readable .md input.
