# Fileverse

Simple file sharing between blockchain addresses. A tool for Web3 communities and individuals. 

## About

Have you ever wanted to share a file with your favorite blockchain address, like vitalik.eth? Or favorite community, say Cryptopunk holders? Or even just a group of anons not using Google Drive or Dropbox?

You can now simply drag and drop your files on Fileverse, and choose who can access them just by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain & your wallet.

We are building Fileverse to make it super easy for individuals, teams, communities, and DAOs, to upload, encrypt and share files with any number of ethereum addresses, while storing on decentralized data storage protocols like IPFS.

What should file sharing between blockchains addresses look like? 

We believe it should be open source, use peer-to-peer storage, offer privacy through strong encryption, have content-addressing to uniquely identify files, and require only a wallet connection to work. No names, no emails and no someone who can censor your files.



### Let’s explore some use-cases together:

1. Do you have exclusive announcements or alpha that you want to share with your token holders or fellow DAO members? Are you a crypto news outlet or podcast that still sends exclusive content to your paying subscribers via EMAIL or DISCORD??? 

    You can now share a document, image or video with anyone that owns a specific NFT (e.g. BAYC or a membership NFT) or token (eg. GTC). Drag and drop the file on Fileverse, set the viewing requirements, and share the link with the world.

    No one will be able to access the file (view & download) except for the addresses that own the NFT or token you set as the access requirement (we call that token-gating). 


2. Want to share a file with your really diverse community but not everyone has an NFT or tokens in common? Are you a crypto conference organizer that still shares timetables and event details via DROPBOX???
  
    Worry not, anon. With Fileverse you can now mint NFTs/tokens and distribute them to all the addresses you want. All that in just a few clicks and with near zero fees thanks to the magic of L2s (xDai/Gnosis chain). The new owners of your NFT/token can now enjoy exclusive content using only their wallet.


3. What? You want to have a permanent URL for your team or community to access token-gated files from? One place to see all files dedicated to your friends? 

    Easy. You can create your own fileverse sub-domain, like Loot.fileverse.io, and use it as your one-stop-shop for all of your token-gated content.


4. Tired of being told crypto or Web3 is just for gambling? Do you want to show your friends and family an easy and useful Web3 tool that does not involve buying or selling anything? Boïïï do we have a website for you! 

    Fileverse can also be used as a simple interface to publish and view content via peer-to-peer storage (IPFS). Introduce your friends and family to decentralized file sharing. They don’t even have to download a wallet to enjoy a basic version of this. Tell them “it’s like google drive, but better”, that should do the trick. 

## Your Help and the Roadmap

Please consider donating to our public goods grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/4846/fileverseio-file-sharing-between-blockchain-addre

Your donations will help us work on Fileverse as much as we would like. That is, A LOT.

It will help us reach the next development milestones we have planned to make Fileverse.io the most simple, secure and open file sharing tool on the Internet.

More importantly, it will help us keep Fileverse free for all. Managing storage on different peer-to-peer data storage networks, running and maintaining nodes on those networks, keeping the highest level of security without compromising on decentralization, all that requires work and funds.

Your donations would help us focus on:
* End-to-end encryption for file sharing between blockchain addresses. The current system has transport and content encryption, but it is not yet end-to-end.
* Increasing the amount of free storage available to users.
* Adding comments on your files for others to see.
* Diversify the data storage networks we use. Arweave and StorJ offer unique advantages that we want to explore. 
* Increase the speed of upload and viewing files.
* Maintaining nodes on different p2p data storage networks.
* ENS integration.
* Notifications (EPNS and Etherscan/Blockscan Chat integration).
* Use-cases 1 and 4 are available for everyone to enjoy. And use-cases 2 and 3 are being developed but require testing and optimisation. The third use case will be a paying option for teams or communities who need lots of space and tailored features.

You can also help us in other ways:
* Star our Github repo!
* Use our app and tell people about it! 
* Become a contributor to Fileverse. Build your own Web3 portfolio by supporting public goods! 
* Give us feedback by creating Github issues.
