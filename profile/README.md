### About Fileverse
We believe in a healthier Internet built on open standards, privacy by design, and data sovereignty. Today, online collaboration and workspaces are mainly serviced through centralized platforms that lock people in and continuously compromise their privacy. Fileverse offers an open alternative that is fast and simple to migrate to.

💛 [ddocs.new](http://ddocs.new/) (Public Beta) is your privacy-enhancing alternative to Google Docs: end-to-end encrypted and decentralized. It supports both async and real-time collaboration, works seamlessly on mobile and desktop, and doesn’t require an account. With dDocs you can write, collaborate, and share knowledge in a self-sovereign way and without sacrificing privacy.

👩‍🏭 [dsheets.new](http://dsheets.new/) (Public Beta): no-code query, read and manipulate financial & onchain data. Use it as your decentralized alternative to Excel and Google Sheets. Built on the same middleware as dDocs which guarantees your self-sovereignty & privacy, by design. Spreadsheets are the world’s most popular reactive functional programming language. dSheets made it ready for the global economy & open Internet.

👩‍💻 [Fileverse Portal ](https://fileverse.io/portal)(Private Beta) is your collaborative space for everyday activities: peer-to-peer file-sharing and storage (with IPFS), publishing decentralized websites/knowledge bases/portfolios, collaborative document editing (via dDocs), brainstorming on whiteboards, and creating communities with decentralized account co-management (via Safe multisigs).

**🛠️ Fileverse SDKs:**
- [HeartBit SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fileverse/heartbit-react): provable, time-based onchain "Likes" that can be generated by simply engaging with your app, website, onchain media, Frame or OpenAction on Farcaster and Lens protocols!
- [Agents SDK](https://agents.fileverse.io/): gives any AI agent the capability to read and write onchain. Out of the box agents get their own Safe smart account, a smart contract on Gnosis, storage space on IPFS, & human-readable .md input.
